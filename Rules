Implemented Rules marked with X, partial with ~

1. X Replace all 'l', 'L', 'r', 'R' with 'w', 'W' respectively
2. ~ Special word conversions (adapted for capital and non-capital letters):
  - X This -> Dis
  - X The -> Te
  - X That -> Dat
3. X If not enough of the text was changed, an 'uwu' is appended (percentual barrier) [implemented as lower percentage for longer sentences]
